I would like to express my deepest gratitude to those who have supported me throughout this research journey.

First, I am grateful to my advisor, Professor Yong Hu, for his guidance. Beyond his academic insights, Professor Hu provided invaluable administrative support that significantly facilitated my research process. 

My sincere thanks go to my fellow participants in the seminar series over the past year, particularly Hairuo Xiao. Our regular discussions and his penetrating insights into algebraic geometry have substantially enriched my understanding of the subject. The collaborative environment we maintained in our study group has been both intellectually stimulating and personally rewarding.

Lastly, I owe immeasurable gratitude to my parents. Their unwavering support - both emotional and financial - has been the foundation upon which I could pursue my academic interests with freedom and dedication.

To all these individuals, I extend my heartfelt appreciation for making this academic endeavor possible.
